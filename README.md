#### Project 12

## Capstone Project

###### This is the final project for the üè° Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.
Currently a WIP. 

You need to make a `config.js` file with the following:

```
const apiKey = 'YOUR-API-KEY';
export default apiKey;

```

You'll need an API key from [Google Street View](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro).

`npm i` to install dependences, then `npm start` to run.


### 3 APIS:
- Google Street View

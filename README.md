#### Project 12

## Survey Marks 🔩

###### This is the final project for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.
🚧 🚧 🚧 Currently a WIP. 🚧 🚧 🚧

You need to make a `config.js` file with the following:

```
module.exports = {
  STREET_VIEW: 'YOUR-GOOGLE-STREET-VIEW-KEY',
  WEATHER: 'YOUR-OPEN-WEATHER-KEY',
  PLACES: 'YOUR-MAPS-JS-KEY'
};

```

You'll need API keys from [Google Street View](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro), [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api), and [Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places).

`npm i` to install dependences, then `npm start` to run.


### 3 APIS:
- Google Street View
- Open Weather Map
- Maps Javascript API
